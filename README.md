# Classic ML Sentiment Analysis

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/josumsc/classic-ml-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/src/IMDB_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb)

As more and more complicated ULMs (Universal Language Model) are out, data scientist move their focus from classic approaches such as linear or probabilistic models to fancier technologies as RNNs or Transformers.

This repository serves as exercise to use simple ML models to perform sentiment analysis, so hopefully we can show they are still relevant to the task. We will be using the famous IMDb dataset located at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) to perform the task of binary sentiment analysis (positive or negative).
